This is opinionated starter code building an EVM dapp. Uses next-js, rainbow-kit, wagmi, tailwind, shad-cn. Bar none the cleanest and best stack to make EVM dapps. Very AI friendly, all the LLMs are very well versed in these frameworks.   

```bash
yarn
npm run dev
# Edit NEXT_PUBLIC_PROJECT_ID= in your .env, this is your WalletConnect project id required for rainbowkit.
```
